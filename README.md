#DA Project

Project done for the [FEUP  Algorithm Design course](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=520321)

Given two CSV's, one with a network of train stations in Portugal, given the source station, destionation station, capacity of that line and servie and the other CSV had information about each Station, such as the district, municipality, Township and line.

The goal of the project was to ask a few questions regarding the information we had, like the maximum number of trains that could go from one station to the other, or given that a small piece of the line was damaged, what was the minimum number of stations that would be affected.

In order to test the project you are asked to introduce the name of the stations you want to get information about, the name has to be as it is in the station dataset.
